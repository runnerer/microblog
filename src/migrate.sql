One such carving is of a person holding a gadget to the eye & looking skywards which means they had a device for looking at the sky.

They were used for both terrestrial applications and astronomy.\n\nThe reflecting telescope, which uses mirrors to collect and focus light, was invented within a few decades of the first refracting telescope.\n\nIn the 20th century, many new types of telescopes were invented, including radio telescopes in the 1930s and infrared telescopes in the 1960s.\n\nThe reflecting telescope, which uses mirrors to collect and focus light, was invented within a few decades of the first refracting telescope.', 'VrGdbTk.jpeg', '2022-11-18 14:39:52'),
	(11, 1, 'NASA and space exploration', 'The idea of sending humans to Mars has been the subject of aerospace engineering and scientific studies since the late 1940s as part of the broader exploration of Mars. Some have also considered exploring the Martian moons of Phobos and Deimos.[1] Long-term proposals have included sending settlers and terraforming the planet. Proposals for human missions to Mars came from e.g. NASA, Russia, Boeing, and SpaceX. As of 2022, only robotic landers and rovers have been on Mars. The farthest humans have been beyond Earth is the Moon.\n\nConceptual proposals for missions that would involve human explorers started in the early 1950s, with planned missions typically being stated as taking place between 10 and 30 years from the time they are drafted.[2] The list of crewed Mars mission plans shows the various mission proposals that have been put forth by multiple organizations and space agencies in this field of space exploration. The plans for these crews have variedâ€”from scientific expeditions, in which a small group (between two and eight astronauts) would visit Mars for a period of a few weeks or more, to a continuous presence (e.g. through research stations, colonization, or other continuous habitation).[citation needed] By 2020, virtual visits to Mars, using haptic technologies, had also been proposed.', 'vFWQe5p.jpeg', '2022-11-18 14:41:29');
